# GitHub-Based Deployment

## ✅ Deployment Updated Successfully!

The workflow has been reconfigured to deploy directly from the GitHub repository instead of local files.

---

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Prefect.yaml Configuration

The deployment now uses `git_clone` to pull the code from GitHub:

```yaml
# Pull configuration - Clone from GitHub
pull:
  - prefect.deployments.steps.git_clone:
      repository: https://github.com/AutoflowsDotDev/stock-market-assistant.git
      branch: master
```

### Deployment Information

- **Deployment ID**: `d6e420bd-cff3-43fa-8012-5599f0464fa3`
- **Version**: `2.0.0`
- **Source Type**: `vcs:git`
- **Repository**: `AutoflowsDotDev/stock-market-assistant`
- **Branch**: `master`
- **Latest Commit**: `ee709447dba3d7a3d49ee92fdde94e0e39e284bd`

## 🚀 How It Works

### Previous Setup (Local):
1. Worker runs on local machine
2. Executes code from local directory
3. Changes require manual sync

### Current Setup (GitHub):
1. Worker receives deployment instruction
2. **Clones code from GitHub repository**
3. Executes the latest code from `master` branch
4. **Automatic updates when you push to GitHub**

---

## 📊 Benefits

✅ **Version Control**: Every deployment is tied to a specific commit  
✅ **Reproducibility**: Can always trace back to exact code version  
✅ **Automatic Updates**: Push to GitHub → Worker pulls latest code  
✅ **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can deploy from same source  
✅ **Rollback Support**: Can deploy from any commit/branch  
✅ **Audit Trail**: Full git history of deployments

## 🛠️ Deployment Commands

### Deploy Using prefect.yaml

```bash
# Deploy all deployments defined in prefect.yaml
prefect deploy --all

# Deploy a specific deployment
prefect deploy -n stock-market-telegram-bot
```

### Trigger a Flow Run

```bash
# Run the deployment (will pull from GitHub)
prefect deployment run 'Stock Market Assistant - Telegram Bot/stock-market-telegram-bot'
```

### Check Deployment Details

```bash
# Inspect deployment configuration
prefect deployment inspect 'Stock Market Assistant - Telegram Bot/stock-market-telegram-bot'

# List all deployments
prefect deployment ls
```

---

## 🔄 Update Workflow

### To Update the Deployed Code:

1. **Make changes locally**
   ```bash
   # Edit your code
   vim stock_market_assistant.py
   ```

2. **Commit and push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update workflow"
   git push
   ```

3. **Redeploy (updates metadata)**
   ```bash
   prefect deploy --all
   ```

4. **Next flow run will use latest code**
   ```bash
   prefect deployment run 'Stock Market Assistant - Telegram Bot/stock-market-telegram-bot'
   ```

## 🎯 Deployment Verification

You can verify the GitHub integration in Prefect Cloud:

1. Go to: https://app.prefect.cloud/
2. Navigate to **Deployments**
3. Click on `stock-market-telegram-bot`
4. Check **Version Info** - should show:
   - Type: `vcs:git`
   - Repository: `AutoflowsDotDev/stock-market-assistant`
   - Commit SHA: Latest commit
   - Branch: `master`

---

## 🔐 Private Repositories (Optional)

If you need to use a private repository:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Create token with `repo` scope

2. **Update prefect.yaml**
   ```yaml
   pull:
     - prefect.deployments.steps.git_clone:
         repository: https://github.com/AutoflowsDotDev/stock-market-assistant.git
         branch: master
         access_token: "{{ prefect.blocks.secret.github-token }}"
   ```

3. **Create Secret Block in Prefect Cloud**
   ```bash
   prefect block register -m prefect.blocks.system
   ```
